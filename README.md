Townhall is a cutting-edge chatbot framework crafted in Python and grounded on the robust Autogen foundation. This isn't just another chatbot; Townhall leverages the power of advanced agents to breathe life into conversations and elevate them to a whole new level.

### üß± The Autogen Foundation: The Bedrock of Innovation
At its core, Townhall is built upon the Autogen framework, a pioneering platform for LLMs. Autogen enables the creation of agents that are not only customizable but also conversational. These agents can interact with each other, and seamlessly incorporate human inputs, setting the stage for more dynamic and intelligent dialogues.

### üéº Advanced Agents: The Symphony Conductors with Function Orchestration
Our advanced agents go beyond merely responding to user queries; they orchestrate multiple functions to provide a cohesive and engaging user experience. Think of them as the conductors of a grand symphony, where each instrument is a unique function or feature. They coordinate these functions to create a harmonious and effective dialogue, far outclassing traditional chatbots which often feel like disjointed sets of scripted responses.
The advanced agents adapt and learn, making each conversation better than the last. They can switch between various modes, employing a blend of LLMs, human inputs, and specialized tools to deliver a personalized conversational experience.

## üåü Features

- **Planner**: The [planner](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/agents/planner.py) initiate chats with the planner, and manage a registry of functions.
- **Function Registry**: The [function registry](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/helpers/function_registry.py) module manages a registry of functions, allowing users to add, execute, and list functions.
- **Buddy**: The [buddy](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/agents/buddy.py) module represents a chatbot that can initiate a chat between a user and an assistant agent.
- **Settings**: The [settings](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/settings.py) module loads environment variables and defines configurations for the application.
- **User Agent**: The [user agent](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/agents/user_agent.py) represents a user in the system and can send messages to other agents.
- **Chat Service**: The [chat service](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/services/chat_service.py) module handles the logic for initiating and managing chats between agents.
- **Function Service**: The [function service](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/services/function_service.py) module provides functionalities for executing specific tasks.
- **Planner Service**: The [planner service](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/services/planner_service.py) module aids in planning and sequencing tasks for the chatbot.
- **Llama Integration**: The Llama module is integrated to provide advanced functionalities. To run Llama locally, follow these steps:
    - Ensure you have all the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Fetch the necessary resources by running the `pull_llama.sh` script located in [app/models/llama/weights/](https://github.com/shoutsid/townhall/blob/main/app/models/llama/weights/). Execute `bash app/models/llama/weights/pull_llama.sh`.
    - To start Llama, run the following command: `python3 app/models/llama/llama.py`.
