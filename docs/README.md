# Jekyll Project for Townhall

![Townhall Banner](banner.png)

This is the Jekyll project set up to create a GitHub Pages site for the Townhall project.
Under heavy development and in transition from a previous personal project. Not ready for production use.
For the full README of the original project, please refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) in the repository root.

## Jekyll Site Structure

The Jekyll project resides in the `docs` folder to facilitate GitHub Pages hosting directly from this directory. The structure is as follows:

- `_config.yml`: The main configuration file for Jekyll.
- `index.md`: The homepage markdown file.
- `_layouts/`: Contains layout files.
- `_posts/`: Contains blog posts.
- `_site/`: The output directory for the generated site (ignored by Git).
- `assets/`: Place for static assets like images and stylesheets.

## Deployment

To deploy this Jekyll site using GitHub Pages, ensure that the repository settings point to use the `docs` folder for GitHub Pages.
